# FutureIntern_AI_02 - Image Generation using Min-DALLE
This project demonstrates generating images from text descriptions using the Min-DALLE model on Google Colab. Min-DALLE is an efficient version of the original DALL-E model by OpenAI, designed for similar image generation capabilities with reduced computational needs.

To run this project, you'll need a Google Colab account with GPU enabled (Runtime > Change runtime type > T4 GPU). We chose Min-DALLE for its powerful yet efficient text-to-image generation, suitable for resource-limited setups like Google Colab. This project showcases the simplicity and power of modern AI models in creative tasks.
